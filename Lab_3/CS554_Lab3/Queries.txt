1. booksByGenre -> no books found what should be done ? throw error or return an empty array
2. publishersByEstablishedYear - > spec says - For the range, just make sure min > 0, make sure that max is >= min and make sure that max cannot be greater than 5 years from the current year.
    should we also be checking that the length is 4 for year?
3. Can searchTerm be an empty string?
4. What do we return after deleteing author/pub/book ?
5. What happens to publisher and authorById in cache when we delete the add/edit/remove book? do we update the cache or delete it from cache?
6. Is clearing the cache same as deleting the key?
7. Remove book - clears the redsi cache => flushall ?
8. Cache chapterById?
9. Valid book name and chapter title?
10. valid date - Do we have to validate for leap year?
11. Edit book : chapters array passed in => delete existing chapters of that book and then add the passed chapters?



12. Chapter Titles should be unique!!! => Is this for a book or entire chapters document
13. Do we need to validate location in Publisher?

add books array in author, Publisher


1. If implementing extra credit, then do we have to cache getChaptersByBookId?
2. If implementing extra credit, should the addBook and editBook mutations still contain the chapters argument or will it be set as an empty array?
3. 



n= even 

n = 8
n/2  = 4
n/2 = 2

n== 2  ==> return a*a

n= odd

convert it into even and then follow the same process
